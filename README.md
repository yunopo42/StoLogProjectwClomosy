# StoLog â€“ Logistics & Inventory Management App

StoLog is a logistics and inventory management application developed during my internship using the **Clomosy platform** and the **TRObject language**.  
The application is designed to streamline stock and shipment processes, especially for companies that operate with **pallet-based storage**.  
Thanks to Clomosyâ€™s infrastructure, StoLog runs smoothly on **both mobile and desktop devices**.

## Features
- **Dashboard:** KPI cards and charts for quick insights  
- **Inventory Module:** Unified gridâ€“formâ€“chart interface for CRUD operations  
- **Logistics Module:** Card-based management of pending shipments with easy selection and delivery tracking  
- **Data Integrity:** SQLite database with PK/FK constraints, parameterized SQL, and transaction handling  
- **Scalability:** Future-ready design for additional features like fleet management, frequent company shortcuts, and customizable shipment templates

## Future Improvements
StoLog is built as a foundation for a **mini ERP system**, and can be expanded with:
- Fleet screen for managing company-owned trucks (plates, drivers, maintenance, costs)  
- Quick-add functionality for frequently used companies and routes  
- Multi-warehouse structure, FIFO/LIFO costing, and multi-currency support  
- Barcode/QR integration and automated alerts (low stock, delivery reminders)  

## About
This project was developed as part of my **internship experience**, where I aimed to analyze real business needs and provide a working solution.  
StoLog not only gave me hands-on practice with Clomosy/TRObject development, but also taught me how to **identify real-world problems and design practical solutions**. ðŸš€
